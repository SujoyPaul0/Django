In this step, try training the model with two features, ``TRIP_MILES`` and ``TRIP_MINUTES``, to see if you can improve the model. You may recall that the original dataset does not include a feature ``TRIP_MINUTES``, but this feature can be easily derived from ``TRIP_SECONDS`` as shown in the code below.*\n",

The two features (TRIP_MILES and TRIP_MINUTES) are on the x and y axis, and the label (FARE) is on the z axis. The plot shows individual examples in the dataset as circles, and the model as a surface (plane). With this 3-D model, if the trained model is good you would expect most of the examples to land on the plane surface. The 3-D plot is interactive so you can explore the data further by clicking or dragging the plot.\n"
